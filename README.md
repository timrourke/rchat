# RChat

_A simple websockets chat platform built with Ruby on Rails._

Rchat is an exploration of using websockets in a Ruby on Rails context. This simple app provides a single-room chat server with basic user authentication. The interface was a perfect opportunity to experiment a bit with a flexbox layout.

Here are a couple screenshots to illustrate:
